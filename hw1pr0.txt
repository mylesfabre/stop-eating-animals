I totally agree with the article's statement that models aren't necessary anymore. I can visualize having SO much data that some patterns begin to emerge. It somehow feels more natural to just wait for the patterns and commonalities to come to you rather than scope them out. There will always be exceptions or mutations in a data set related to people or nature, so models seem to never be 100% correct. This unique and effective usage of mass data also explains why big tech companies are selling data to other tech companies and analytic companies. It allows for more effective analysis of markets or occurrences. Maybe there should be a cloud based modeling system that really isn't a model, but rather a collection of massive amounts with remote super computer access to analyze it.
