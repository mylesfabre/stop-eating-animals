When engines suggest surprising moves, or arrangements of pieces that look "ugly" to human sensibilities, they are often seeing more deeply into the game than their users. Starting from this point, consider one or two areas other than chess in which our aesthetic intuition may be limiting our success unnecessarily. Or is it necessarily?

	Human intuition most often desires pleasing or beautiful solutions to different problems. However, these "nice" solutions may not be the most efficient option. For example, in the design of some cars (notably pickup trucks and suvs), the manufacturer wants cars to strike emotion or awe in their consumers. However, the most aerodynamic solution would be the most "successful" option, in terms of efficiency. In this example, I believe this aesthetic intuition is unnecessary in regards to the formality of machine building. Moreover, it is necessary in providing variety, providing the spice of life. International car culture would take a huge blow if vehicles turned ugly for the sake of efficiency.
	Another example, architecture; in the designing of buildings, architects want to make an aesthetically appealing buildings while maintaining functionality. However, when buildings are designed purely for functionality, the result can be ugly. There seems to be a common dilemma of wanting to make functional things beautiful. These things (machines, buildings, etc.) can be altered to sacrifice looks for functionality and vice versa, but we humans tend to find a balance to maximize both qualities.
