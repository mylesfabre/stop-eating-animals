This article distinguishes between algorithms and authors, e.g., often, algorithms and online results simply reflect people's attitudes and behavior. To what extent do you agree that algorithms are (or aren't) subjective as a judge of human beings? 

I believe these algorithms are objective by design. These algorithms make assumptions based on the user input they are given, and we can't be mad at that. But, I assume from reading the article, these algorithms aren't designed to take into account common cultural prejudices and stereotypes and adjust to make more informed decisions. That's what would make these algorithms more subjective; adding features that increase the decision making capabilities. But with features like this, we must be sure to maintain equality in advertising, etc. We don't want algorithms with these enhanced decision capabilities to overarch and go to the other end of the spectrum where we don't accurately depict human behavior. For example, we don't want Google auto complete to suggest wild suggestions to complete sentences. But for now, I think these algorithms need to be tweaked to consider 'majority ad consideration' to see if targeting an audience is appropriate.
