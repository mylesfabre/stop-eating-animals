1. The article makes the claim that the water-droplet computer has a "universal nature." What circuit-level functionality did the researchers need to show in order to claim universality, i.e., that their computer could compute anything that an ordinary computer could?
They had to prove that the droplets could function as logic gates and that they could run as a clock. Most computers use clocks to make sure that logic gates don't run operations at the same time. So the researchers had to make sure that the droplet computer could do the same things as the circuits in a normal computer.

2. The article contrasts the water-droplet computer with our era's silicon devices by noting that the droplet computer works by distributing physical matter (well, water as opposed to electrons, at least). Insofar as biological organisms are "a type of computer" (not an agreed-upon point, for sure), are they fundamentally computing by moving matter, by moving electrons, or some other physical interaction? This is not a neuroscience question, or even a question with a right or wrong answer. Rather, it's one of perspective: what is the raw material, fundamentally, that biological computers are manipulating, in your opinion?
I'm guessing that biological systems manipulate information in the fluid in their bodies using electricity. I know this isn't a neuroscience question, but the biological computation happens in the brain and the brain uses synapse which rely on electro chemical reactions. But the medium by which the computation happens is very different than a regular computer. The manipulation of physical mater in the body allows different parts of the body to work without all of its pieces. For example, if we cut a circuit off of a logic board of a computer, the computer would most likely not work anymore. However, if we remove a piece of someone's brain, there is a chance that they will be ok. This is probably due to the matter that the computations are working through.
