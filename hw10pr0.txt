How did you do? To what extent do you feel that automatic authoring is a positive (or negative) development? As usual, thoughtful middle paths (or alternative viewpoints) are welcome...

	I guessed 5 out of 6 correctly on the quiz! The machine generated texts didn't have skip line references that circled back to what the poem was about. So it was fairly easy to identify the poems that mostly made grammatical sense, yet lacked a singular tone throughout the poem. I believe automatic authoring is cool for companies that need to have the technology to stay afloat and relevant. The industries mentioned in the article: financial, sports, and other data heavy and rapidly changing environments need this authoring to reach their respective audiences. However, for more pressing publications, like CNN breaking news or similar, I'd prefer a human author to provide emotions and take my interest through their writing. I really appreciate raw journalism, and if published news becomes an algorithm emotionlessly stating a things that happen, I can see myself becoming less interested about reading the content. I don't think that automatic authoring is negative, I just think it should have its place in the wide world of published literature.
