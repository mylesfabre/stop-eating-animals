I sometimes feel as if my language, English, has gotten in the way of me being able to express my ideas. For example, I would be engaged in a conversation, and would need to find a word to describe something. Yet, my mind would freeze, unable to choose any one or combination of words to best communicate my feelings. In terms of what the article read, my situation is synonymous to the Guugu Yimithirr being immediately unable to communicate directions using a freed axis directions. As I type this response, I ran into trouble trying to describe the system of directions that I use. I wish i could just spill how I'm trying to communicate into someone's ears or onto a paper, a paper that's ready for someone to absorb and understand what I'm feeling. 

The movie Arrival, directed by Denis Villeneuve, explores linguistics and it was super interesting. In the movie, alien spaceships land around the world and a world renown linguist boards one of their ships. The linguist  spends an amount of time trying to understand the aliens' circular language. TL;DR the language is a gift from the aliens and unlocks a new level of human understanding. I really hopes this happens in real life so I don't embarrass myself mid-conversation trying to find a fitting word or phrase.
