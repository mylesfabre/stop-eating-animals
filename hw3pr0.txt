1. PROBABLY! We don't know why we are here, on earth, in space, ~in this simulation~, etc. So it would be really nice to know that we're just someone's random simulation. If this is a simulation, it's VERY impressive. Or maybe it's a really simple simulation in the future. I can imagine the SUPER SUPER DUPER computers of the future processing and accessing SO MUCH DATA. Like so much data that petabytes seem less than bytes. WOAH. I wanna be in the future :(. Wait no, I like my life.
2. If I found out we were in a simulation, I would probably cry because my life would really be fake and made up. But otherwise, I would probably not act any differently. I still have a purpose in this simulation and I live to please my creator (not really). But I don't want to have a bad experience in this simulation. I want to be my best. But I do think there would be lots of suicides worldwide and also the idea of religion would crash or just shift from God, Gods, Vishnu, Buddha, nature, etc to the creator of the simulation? And some would totally reject the idea that we are in a simulation. But aside from other people, I'd be chillin and living my "life" in my simulation world.  :)
